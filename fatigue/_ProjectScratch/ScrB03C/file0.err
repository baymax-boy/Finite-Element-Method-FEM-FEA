 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       0.203   TIME= 21:10:33
 Element shape checking is currently inactive.  Issue SHPP,ON or         
 SHPP,WARN to reactivate, if desired.                                    

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       0.203   TIME= 21:10:33
 Material number 10 (used by element 4656) should normally have at least 
 one MP or one TB type command associated with it.  Output of energy by  
 material may not be available.                                          

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       0.781   TIME= 21:10:33
 For element 4656 the element connectivity is 0 and 6843.  The node      
 which is identified as a 0 will be a grounded node.                     

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       0.953   TIME= 21:10:33
 Pivoting has been activated for the Distributed Sparse Matrix Solver .  
 The memory required may greatly exceed the predicted amount.  In that   
 event, use the DSPOPTION command to change the memory mode and/or       
 memory size used by the Distributed Sparse Matrix Solver.               

 *** ERROR ***                           CP =       0.953   TIME= 21:10:33
 Element 502 (type = 3, SOLID186) (and maybe other elements) has become  
 highly distorted.  Excessive distortion of elements is usually a        
 symptom indicating the need for corrective action elsewhere.  Try       
 ramping the load up instead of step applying the load (KBC,1).  You     
 may need to improve your mesh to obtain elements with better aspect     
 ratios.  Also consider the behavior of materials, contact pairs,        
 and/or constraint equations.  Please rule out other root causes of      
 this failure before attempting rezoning or nonlinear adaptive           
 solutions.  If this message appears in the first iteration of first     
 substep, be sure to run shape checking of elements.
